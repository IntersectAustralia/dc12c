If you are an administrator, you will be able to edit the details of papyri images.

When you are viewing a papyrus, you will have the following options:

## Add an Image
Click "Upload"

(TODO add image)

A image has three fields: the image itself, a caption, and an ordering.

These are fairly self-explanatory except "ordering".
Ordering is optional and defines the position an image will show up in the list.
It is a single uppercase letter.
e.g. An image with ordering "A" will appear before an image with ordering "C".

The first image (ordered by ordering) is the image that is displayed in thumbnail format in various places around the site.

Click "Save" or "Cancel" once you are done.

## Edit an Image
Click "Edit" near the image you wish to edit.

(TODO add image)

You can fill in a new caption or change the ordering.

Click "Save" or "Cancel" once you are done.

## Delete a Image
Once you are on an edit image page, you can click delete to remove the image.
Be careful, as there is no undo when deleting an image.
