If you are an administrator, you will be able to edit the details of papyri connections.

When you are viewing a papyrus, you will have the following options:

## Add a Connection
Click "Add Connection"

{% pic newconnection New Connection %}

A connection has two fields: the related papyrus MQT number, and a description.
Both are required.

Click "Save" or "Cancel" once you are done.

## Edit a Connection
Click "Edit" near the connection you wish to edit.

{% pic editconnection Edit Connection %}

The fields are the same as on the new connection page.
Update them as you wish.

Click "Save" or "Cancel" once you are done.

## Delete a Connection
Once you are on an edit connection page, you can click delete to remove a connection.
Be careful, as there is no undo when deleting a connection.
