If you are an administrator, you will be able to edit the details of papyri names.

When you are viewing a papyrus, you will have the following options:

## Add a Name
Click "Add Name"

{% pic addname Add Name%}

You can describe:
* names
* role (Author or Associate)
* note about the role
* added information
* date
* ordering

These are fairly self-explanatory except "ordering".
Ordering defines the position a name will show up in the list.
It is a single uppercase letter.
e.g. A name with ordering "A" will appear before a name with ordering "C".

Click "Save" or "Cancel" once you are done.

## Edit a Name
Click "Edit" near the name you wish to edit.

{% pic editname Edit Name %}

The fields are the same as on the new name page.
Update them as you wish.

Click "Save" or "Cancel" once you are done.

## Delete a Name
Once you are on an edit name page, you can click delete to remove a name.
Be careful, as there is no undo when deleting a name.
