As mentioned throughout this manual, there are some restrictions to what you can view based on if you are logged in or not, an admin or not, and if you have an approved access request or not.

## Visibility Levels
There are three visibility levels:
* Public - full detail, including high resolution images
* Visible - low detail
* Hidden - least detail

If you are not logged in, you will see only visible and public records.

If you are logged in, you will see all records.

If you are interested in a particular record to research, you should request access to it.

## Changing Visibility
Administrators can change the visibility of a record by using the controls at the top of the view page.
{% pic visibilitycontrols Visibility Controls %}

## Requesting Access
Once you are logged in and viewing the record you would like full access to, click "Request Access" at the top.
If an administrator approves your request, you will then be able to view it in full detail (as if it were a public record).

{% pic requestaccess Request Access%}

2. Choose the request you are interested in
3. Select Approve or Reject

## Revoking Access
From the admin page:
1. View the approved requests
2. Choose the request you are interested in.
