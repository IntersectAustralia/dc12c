If you are an administrator, you can create an account for somebody who has a OneID.

From the admin tab, click "New OneID Account".

1. Search for the user by filling in at least one field - an exact OneID or part of a first and/or last name.
2. Then press "Search".
3. Click "Create" next to the user you want to add to the system.

{% pic newoneid New OneID Account %}


They can now login with their OneID credentials.
