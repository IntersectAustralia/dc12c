Everybody is able to view collections.
In addition, if you are an administrator, you will be able to edit the details of collections.

## Creating a Collection
From the collection list page, click "New Collection" at the top of the page.

From here, you can describe a title, description, keywords (semi-colon separated), spatial/temporal coverage, and of course name the papyri themselves.
The required fields are title, description and keywords.
Click Save or Cancel at the bottom once you are done.
